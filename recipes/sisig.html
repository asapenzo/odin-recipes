    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sisig is probably the most famous Kapampangan dish in the Philippines that is also gaining a lot of attention worldwide.  
        You would easily find it in the menus of most restaurants, bars, or even common small food stalls called, Carinderias.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sisig that most people know is a modern-day version of what it was in earlier years. 
        The Kapampangan word 'sisig' actually means to snack on something sour (normally unripe fruit in vinegar dressing).  
        It was originally a very sour dish because of all the vinegar and/or calamansi juice in it. 
        It was not until later that pork or other meat was used.
