    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and like all traditional dishes, there are many variations – including different proteins like pork and beef.
        Fundamentally though, the key ingredients are the right balance of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper and sugar that create an incredibly sticky glaze that has a depth of flavour like it’s been slow cooked – but it’s not!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>boneless skinless chicken thighs – cannot substitute with breast, need the fat to transform sauce into a glaze;</li>
        <li>soy sauce – all purpose or light soy sauce. NOT dark soy sauce (bottle will be labelled as such if it’s dark soy sauce);</li>
        <li>white vinegar – just everyday, plain white vinegar. Sub with any clear vinegar, including rice wine, apple cider, sherry vinegar;</li>
        <li>onion and garlic;</li>    
        <li>peppercorns – or coarse cracked pepper;</li>
        <li>sugar – brown best, white ok;</li>
        <li>bay leaves – fresh or dried, not the end of the world if you don’t have; and</li>
        <li>green onion – optional garnish
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through</li>
        <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
        <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
        <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.</li>
